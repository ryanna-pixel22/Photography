            <p>Hello, My name is Ryanna Jelks and I am ready to capture life's precious moments with you!
                I'm currently an undergrad student at Indiana University, majoring in Informatics.The work I am excited about is
                being involved in something bigger than myself and making a difference in the world of technology to improve
                peopleâ€™s lives.
                I am an aspiring photographer that developed a passion for the art of photography
                in highschool. I recently have been countuining this passion since I have been on Indiana University Campus. I
                started taking landscape photos now I have been taking portraits of friends. Being able to make people feel like
                themselves and bring out their confidence. </p>
            <p class="farewell">I would be honored to take photos for you, your special day, or anything in between!</p>
